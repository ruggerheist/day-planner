# DAY PLANNER

## Descrption
A daily planner to keep a users schedule for the work day. Activities are color coded by time of day. Gray blocks are past events, the red block is the present events, and blocks in green are upcoming. JQuery was the preferred language of this project.

## Usage
The user may simply input their acitivity to the corresponding hour and click the save button associated with that hour. Storage is perpetual and can be changed daily because the time and date will automatically update to the current day and time.
